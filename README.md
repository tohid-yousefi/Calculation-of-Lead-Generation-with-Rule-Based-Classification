# Rule Based Classification
📌 **Rule-based classifiers** are just another type of classifier which makes the class decision depending by using various “if..else” rules. These rules are easily interpretable and thus these classifiers are generally used to generate descriptive models. The condition used with “if” is called the antecedent and the predicted class of each rule is called the consequent.

# Problem Definition
📌 A game company wants to create level-based new customer definitions (personas) using some features of its customers, and to create segments according to these new customer definitions and to estimate how much the new customers can earn on average according to these segments.

# Dataset
📌 The Persona.csv dataset contains the prices of the products sold by an international game company and some demographic information of the users who buy these products. The data set consists of records created in each sales transaction. This means that the table is not deduplicated. In other words, a user with certain demographic characteristics may have made more than one purchase.
# Variables
* *PRICE*: Customer spend amount,
* *SOURCE*: The type of device the customer is connecting to (IOS/Android),
* *SEX*: Gender of the customer,
* *COUNTRY*: Country of the customer,
